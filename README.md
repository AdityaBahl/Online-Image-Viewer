# Why Online Image Viewer?

There are several motivations for using an Online Image Viewer, some of which are:

# Challenges and limitations of OpenCV

There are a few limitations to using OpenCV for face detection:

1. Performance depends on the quality of the classifier: The performance of the face detection
   function in OpenCV depends on the quality of the classifier used. If the classifier is not
   trained well or if it is not well-suited to the images it is being applied to, it may not perform
   as well. This can lead to false positives (detecting a face where there is none) or false
   negatives (failing to detect a face that is present).
2. Limited ability to customize the classifier: The face detection classifier included with OpenCV
   is pre-trained and cannot be easily customized. This means that you cannot easily adjust the
   classifier to better suit your specific needs or to improve its performance on a particular
   dataset.
3. May not work well on images with low resolution or poor lighting: Face detection algorithms
   can be sensitive to the resolution and quality of the input images. If the images are low
   resolution or have poor lighting, the classifier may not perform as well.
4. May not work well on faces with unusual or extreme appearance: Face detection algorithms
   are designed to detect "typical" faces, and they may not perform as well on faces with
   unusual or extreme appearance, such as very large or small faces, or faces with unusual
   facial features or expressions.
   Overall, while OpenCV is a powerful tool for face detection, it does have some limitations in terms of
   performance, customization, and robustness to variations in the input images. These limitations
   should be taken into consideration when using OpenCV for face detection.

# Conclusion

I learned many new techniques and enjoyed the process. There were a lot of problems, but
removing errors is what we must learn. The project may not give accurate results in some cases as
mentioned above, and there are quite a few correct solutions too, I will explore this domain further.
